Schema Sync a MySQL Schema Versioning and Migration Utility
Synopsis

                schemasync [options] <source> <target>

                # source/target format: mysql://user:pass@host:port/database
                # output format: <database>[_<tag>].YYYYMMDD.(patch|revert)[_<version>].sql
            

Description

Schema Sync will generate the SQL necessary to migrate the schema of a source database to a target database (patch script), as well as a the SQL necessary to undo the changes after you apply them (revert script).

    Schema Sync does not alter your database. It only generates the .sql files containing the differences. You must apply the changes.
    All ADD|MODIFY COLUMN statements have the AFTER (or FIRST) SQL syntax even if no move is required.
    COMMENTS and AUTO_INCREMENT values are not by synced by default. See help (-h) for details.
    Schema Sync does not yet recognize Tables or Columns that have been renamed. A rename will result in the old table or column being dropped and the new one added.
    Partitions (MySQL 5.1+) are not yet supported 

Examples

    Sync the production db with the changes from the development db


        schemasync mysql://user:pass@dev-host:3306/dev_db mysql://user:pass@prod-host:3306/production_db

    Bob and Sally were working on independent parts of the application that required schema changes. Migrate these changes to the SAN so they can be tested and later rolled up to the production db.


        schemasync --tag="bob" --ouput-dir="/location/of/san/" \
                       mysql://user:pass@dev-host:3306/dev_db_bob mysql://user:pass@prod-host:3306/production_db


        schemasync --tag="sally" --ouput-dir="/location/of/san/" \
                     mysql://user:pass@dev-host:3306/dev_db_sally mysql://user:pass@prod-host:3306/production_db
